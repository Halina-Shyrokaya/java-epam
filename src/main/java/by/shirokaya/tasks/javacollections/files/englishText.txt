John Birges was a Hungarian immigrant to Clovis, California.
He flew for the German Luftwaffe during World War Two.
He was captured and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in the Soviet gulag.
Eight years into his sentence in the gulag, he was released during a period of mass repatriation of POWs held in the Soviet Union
to their home countries, and returned to Hungary. From there, he immigrated to the USA and built a successful landscaping business,
but his addiction to gambling led to his losing a large amount of money and prompted the bomb plot.
His gambling debt and experience with explosives were primary pieces of evidence linking him to the bombing.
